# ECE369_Final_Project
Final project for ECE369 of Fall 2021
Developers: James Fulton, Raphael Lepercq, & Wilson Liao

Notes:
1) Please do not directly copy code. Any ideas however may be reasonably resused if you create your own Verilog based implementation.
2) This final project was initially developed for the final competition, but our group had changed goals. It instead utilizes the extra credit opporunities listed below
    a) A custom instruction that utilizes concurrent memory access as well as immediate 'SAD' value calculations.
    b) Datapath pipline stage forwarding.
3) This datapath was developed for the Nexys A7 Artix-7 FPGA (#: XC7A100TCSG324-1) within Xilinx Vivado 2019.2.1
   (can work with 2021.2 if new project created while importing required files)
